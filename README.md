## Sinatra ActiveRecord CRUD

1. Implement all four CRUD actions in a Sinatra application.
2. Understand how each CRUD action corresponds to a controller action and POST
   request.

## Instructions

We've had a lot of practice with the ActiveRecord CRUD actions, so now it's
time to tie them to controller actions in a Sinatra application. In this lab,
you'll be building a basic blog post app, using every CRUD action.

**Important:** In Sinatra, the order in which you define your routes in a
controller matters. Routes are matched in the order they are defined. So, if we
were to define the `get '/posts/:id'` route _before_ the `get '/posts/new'`
route, Sinatra would feed all requests for `/posts/new` to the `/posts/:id`
route and we should see an error telling us that your app is unable to find a
`Post` instance with an `id` of `"new"`. The takeaway is that you should define
your `/posts/new` route _before_ your `/posts/:id` route.

### Database

First, you'll need to create the `posts` table. A blog post should have a name
and content.

Next, set up the corresponding `Post` model. Make sure the class inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base`.

### Create

Now that we have the database and model set up, it's time to set up the ability
to create a blog post.

First, create a route in your controller, `get '/posts/new'`, that renders the
`new.erb` view.

We need to create an erb file in the views directory, `new.erb`, with a form
that POSTs to a controller action, `/posts`. The controller action should use
the Create CRUD action to create the blog post and save it to the database.
When the form on `new.erb` is submitted, the action, pointing to `/posts`,
will trigger a render of an `index.erb` file automatically. Before we can
fully test if our form is working, we need to create that `index.erb` file, as
our site will currently crash upon submission.

### Read

The Read CRUD action corresponds to two different controller actions: show and
index. The show action should render the erb view `show.erb`, which shows an
individual post. The index action should render the erb view `index.erb`, which
shows a list of _all_ of the posts.

Create the `get '/posts'` controller action. This action should use Active
Record to grab _all_ of the posts and store them in an instance variable,
`@posts`. Then, it should render the `index.erb` view. That view should use erb
to iterate over `@posts` and render them on the page.

Create the `get '/posts/:id'` controller action. This action should use Active
Record to grab the post with the `id` that is in the params and set it equal to
`@post`. Then, it should render the `show.erb` view page. That view should use
erb to render the `@post`'s title and content.

### Update

The Update CRUD action corresponds to the edit controller action and view.

Create a controller action, `get '/posts/:id/edit'`, that renders the view,
`edit.erb`. This view should contain a form to update a specific blog post and
POSTs to a controller action, `patch '/posts/:id'`.

You'll need to make sure the edit form includes:

```html
<input id="hidden" type="hidden" name="_method" value="patch">
```

**Reminder:** Remember to add the `use Rack::MethodOverride` to your
`config.ru` file so that your app will know how to handle `patch` and `delete`
requests!

### Delete

The Delete CRUD action corresponds to the delete controller action,
`delete '/posts/:id/delete'`. To initiate this action, we'll just add a "delete
button" to the show page. This "button" will actually be a form, disguised as a
button (intriguing, I know). The form will send a POST request to the delete
controller action, where we will identify the post to delete and delete it.
Then, the action should render a `delete.erb` view which confirms that the post
has been deleted.

#### Making our Delete "Button"

In order to make a form that looks like a button, all we need to do is make a
form that has no input fields, only a "submit" button with a value of "delete".
So, give your form tag a method of `"post"` and an action of
`"/posts/:id/delete'`. Make sure to dynamically set the `:id` of the form
action! You'll also need to make sure the form includes the hidden input tag to
change the request from `post` to `delete`.
